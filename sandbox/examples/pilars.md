# Pillars of OOPs

## 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is wrapping up the data and methods together within a single entity. In C++, classes are used for encapsulation.

## 2. Abstraction

Showing only the necessary details and hiding the internal details is known as abstraction.

## 3. Polymorphism

Providing different functionalities to the functions or operators of the same name is known as Polymorphism.

C++ provides two types of polymorphism:

Compile-time Polymorphism can be achieved using:
Operator overloading
Function overloading
Runtime Polymorphism can be achieved using:
Function overriding
Virtual Functions

## 4. Inheritance

Deriving the properties of a class (Parent class) to another class (Child class) is known as Inheritance. It is used for code reusability.

Types of Inheritance:

Single Inheritance: When a derived class inherits the properties of a single base class, it is known as Single Inheritance.

Multiple Inheritance: When a derived class inherits the properties of multiple base classes, it is known as Multiple Inheritance.

Multilevel Inheritance: When a derived class inherits the properties of another derived class, it is known as Multilevel Inheritance.

Hierarchical Inheritance: When more than one derived class inherits the properties of a single base class, it is known as Hierarchical Inheritance.

Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance: When we combine more than one type of inheritance, it is known as Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance. Example: Combining Multilevel and Hierarchical inheritance.
